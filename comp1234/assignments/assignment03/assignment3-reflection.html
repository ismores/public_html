        Working on this assignment wasn’t too difficult for me because I had some experience with JavaScript back in 2022. Even though I only studied it for one semester, I was able to learn the basics. The Dash General Assembly project felt similar to this one because it also involved debugging and making sure the code worked. All the projects and assignments I’ve done over the past few years helped me feel more confident with this task.

        One challenge I faced was creating the right folder structure and linking the files properly. I had to make sure the HTML and JavaScript files were set up correctly and connected, which meant getting the paths right for everything. When there were problems with broken links or references, I would double-check the file paths and use the developer tools in my browser to look for errors. I learned that even small mistakes in the file structure could cause problems, but fixing those issues taught me how important it is to keep everything organized.
        
        Like in previous assignments and labs, I also faced some challenges, like other students on campus. I had trouble accessing FileZilla, and the server side would just load forever, not allowing me to upload files.
        
        The hardest part of the assignment was Part 3, especially when I had to use "Magic." It took me a while to figure out, but with my friend’s help, I was able to solve the issue. This experience showed me how important it is to be persistent and keep trying when debugging or solving problems.
        
        Thanks to the professor’s help and the resources provided, I was able to understand the relationship between HTML and file structure better. This assignment taught me how important debugging is and how all the tools and concepts in programming work together to make everything work in the end.
