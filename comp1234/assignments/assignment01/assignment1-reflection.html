    <h2>My Reflection</h2>

    <p>Working on this assignment was not too difficult for me because I had some experience with HTML from high school. I learned a lot about organizing folders and files, which is important for keeping everything structured and easy to navigate. Understanding how to set up a folder structure helps ensure that all parts of a project are in the right place, making it easier to manage.

      I figured out how to use absolute, document, and root-relative links to connect files and folders within the assignment. This knowledge is crucial because it allows me to link different parts of my website accurately. I also gained experience linking to external URLs in an HTML document, which is a valuable skill for referencing resources in my future projects.

      The main challenge I faced was linking my picture to a document-relative link. It took me about 30 minutes to figure this out, but my notes from the third lab were really helpful. I want to thank Professor Leo for being eager to teach even while recovering from surgery; you made sure we understood the material.

      At first, I was confused about the differences between document-relative and root-relative links because the PDF didnâ€™t include an example for document-relative links, which made it a bit tricky.

      Additionally, I spent almost an hour troubleshooting broken links because the GBLEARN site wasn't showing my assignment01 folder. I had to think carefully to resolve this issue. In the end, I reuploaded my assignment01 with both my index.html and assignment1-reflection.html files, and that fixed everything.

      Overall, this assignment helped me develop the skills to create well-organized projects and gain experience in troubleshooting broken links. I now feel more confident in my web development skills and look forward to using what I learned in future projects.
