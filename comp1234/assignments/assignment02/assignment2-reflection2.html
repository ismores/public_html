						<p>
							Working on this assignment was kind of difficult for me. It took me like hours to figure out about margins and padding. Additionally, I also struggled in the gallery part and with the guest section since we cannot use flexbox in our assignments. But that didn't stop me from doing better on this assignment; it took me like weeks to perfect it. Working on this assignment helped me improve my learning in HTML and CSS. Understanding which elements should be selected and which pseudocode elements should be used to make the web page good is very important. This knowledge is significant for upcoming front-end developers because it allows them to enhance their skills in problem-solving and creativity.
						</p>

							I also gained experience animating by playing with the transform and transition elements. The main challenge that I faced in this assignment was maintaining the spacing of each card and deciding which background image to use. It took me hours to figure out how it works. My notes from past labs were really helpful. Additionally, uploading the files was hard for me since I had to connect to my mobile data to use FileZilla and view my website on the Gblearn server. I emailed Professor Maziar about this, but it seems it’s still not working. I did troubleshoot it, but it’s still not resolved, so I just found a way to make it work.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Overall, this assignment helped me become a great student because it helped me develop skills to create organized websites and gain experience in debugging code. I now feel more confident in my web development skills and look forward to learning JavaScript.
